# Security Considerations

Ciphera's model focuses on cryptography over trust:
- **Malicious nodes:** Cannot access plaintext
- **Network adversaries:** Ciphertext and proofs are safe
- **Compromised clients:** Ephemeral keys limit exposure
- **On-chain verification:** Immutable record ensures accountability
