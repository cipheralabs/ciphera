# Introduction

## What is Ciphera?
Ciphera is a Solana-native protocol for encrypted computation and private state. It enables confidential analytics, client-side encryption, off-chain computation, and on-chain verification without exposing plaintext data.

### Key Capabilities
- Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
- Homomorphic computation on encrypted data
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- On-chain state commitments with privacy guarantees

## Goals
- **Zero Plaintext Exposure:** Data remains encrypted from client to compute node.
- **Trustless Verification:** Proofs verifiable on-chain.
- **Developer Experience:** Simple SDK and CLI for privacy-preserving apps.
- **Performance:** Optimized for Solana's compute unit constraints.

## Supported Use Cases
- Private voting
- Privacy-preserving analytics
- Confidential user state management

## Design Philosophy
- Cryptographic guarantees over trust
- Minimal on-chain footprint
- Modular SDK for rapid development
